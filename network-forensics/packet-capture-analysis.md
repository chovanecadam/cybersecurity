# Network Capcure

## Toolset

Documentation for all wireshark tools can be found 
[here](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/) 
(including Berkeley Packet Filter tcpdump and wireshark use 
for packet capture). Wireshark display-filter reference can be found
[here][wireshark-filters].

[Chapter](../osint/README.md) about open-source intelligence
contains a list of tools which are very useful for packet capture
analysis (identifying hosts, subdomains, MAC manufacturers, etc.)

## Examples

```bash
# capture tls traffic on interface eth0, rotate every 5 minutes
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap -G 600 "port 443"

# capture only packet with SYN and FIN flags set
tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0'

# split large capture to one-hour files
editcap -i 3600 capture.pcap capture.pcap
```
